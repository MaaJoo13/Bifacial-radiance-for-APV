This repo holds bifacial_radiance simulations for the agrivoltaics use case.

The agrivoltaics model is available here:
https://github.com/rl-institut/oemof-tabular-plugins

For the sake of it, a 'geometry.json' file containing precalculated RADIANCE results is used.
That file was created using bifacial_radiance_scripts/geometry_11.py from this repository.
